|         Analyzing Airline Flight Delays     | 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

For this assignment, you can use whatever software you prefer.  However, this exam has been written
to be addressed with the split-apply-combine philosophy in general and dplyr in particular (Pandas
is the standard analogue in Python, though Pandas has been written to mimic R’s framework).

For this exam, we will be analyzing airline flight delays.  The first step in the exam will be downloading the
flight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics:

https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time

See the code “getFlightData.R” for instructions on how to download and convert the data to an R object.

We went over in class some basic functions behind dplyr (coreCommandsStudents.R) that can get you started.  Note that 
data we looked at in that code is NOT the data for the exam.
Warm-up questions (choose at least 3):
* How many total flights are there in the data set?* How many flights were there for each day of the week?* Which month has the greatest proportion of late flights? Formally test 
  the question: is there any difference in the true proportion of late flights across months?* Which day is best for minimizing average departure delays? 
* Which departure and arrival airport combination is associated with the worst median delay?Main submission:Train a predictive model for how delayed a flight will be.  What are the 3 most important features you’ve found and by what criteria? What is the cross-validation estimate of the risk for your procedure? What is the training error estimate of the risk?Note that this doesn’t have to be “complicated” in the sense that a well done basic approach is preferable to a 
partially completed complicated approach.


You should return to me the following two, separate items:
    - A write-up entitled firstnameLastname_warmup.pdf that contains your answers to the five warm-up questions.     
      Just state the questions and your answers in a very brief yet readable format.


    - A write-up entitled firstnameLastname_main.pdf that describes your predictive model. 
      Some things that need to be obviously and explicitly included:
          * 3 most important features you found and how you judged importance
          * training error of your procedure
          * cross-validation error of your procedure
          * A description of your chosen procedure including why you chose it.
      

General rules for both submissions:
* Don’t worry about making your submission look like an “essay”.  Use whatever format you feel is appropriate,
  just make it easily readable
* Either (use Rmarkdown) or (use a different document preparation system (exporting to pdf) 
  and include the code you use as an appendix)
  (in either case, don’t include your entire code. Only include the code necessary for answering the questions. Note this means 
   there will probably be a substantial difference between the code you write during the exam and the code
   that you end up submitting.  To this end, I recommend simultaneously developing two scripts, one that includes
   all of your explorations and the other containing only the “final version”).  
*  Do not include any superfluous output or discussions.  Only include output and code that directly addresses 
   the stated goal(s) for the submission.  

Evaluation: Your grade on this exam will be based on the following:

- Warm-up [30 points]. 
- Main    [70 points]. 

If you include any code written by anyone but you (other than from the book, lecture notes, homeworks, or
packages) either exactly or substantially similar, be sure to provide proper attribution, including a 
URL, text, author, etc. or other available information. It is fine to do so, but make sure (for your sake)
you have a very clear understanding of what the code is doing and that you cite your source.
